# Visual Communication in Data Science
The most important skill for a Data Scientist to develop is communication.  It is their responsibility to discover insights with data to drive decision-making, but not to make the decisions themselves.  For this reason, I would argue that accurate and effective communication is more important than any algorithm, model, or package.

Each type of communication is different, but provides a well-rounded way of providing the same information.  We can classify these into four categories, aligned with four types of learners:  visual, written, hearing, and tacital.  Here, we concern ourselves with the visual learner.

Plots are vital to not only getting the point across but also to ensure that the message stays with the individual.  Even so, we find that overly complicated or cluttered plots are used all too frequently within our industry.  Instead of bombarding you with [the typical military graphic](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/world/27powerpoint.html), we can take a look at an example that is easy to fix.
